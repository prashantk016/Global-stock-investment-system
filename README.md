The fee for portfolio management services can vary widely among management companies. In terms of structure, fees may include asset-based management fee, which is calculated based on the asset valuation at the beginning of the service. Since this fee is guaranteed to the manager, it is typically a lower amount. Alternatively, the fee maybe tied to profits earned by the portfolio manager of the owner. In such cases, the risk-based fee is usually much higher.
